//I score a two pointer then it should add on to the *current* score whatever it is, same with a three pointer
// When a player reaches 21, the game-sealing activates. Otherwise it does nothing
// After game-sealing 3 activates and is clicked that player(1-2-3) will win
// When a player wins, they get added to the winner list and previous winner list until knocked out
// When a new player wins, they get added to the winner and the previous winner gets displayed
